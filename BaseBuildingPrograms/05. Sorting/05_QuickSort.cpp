// Quick Sort: We pick a element called pivot element, and partition the array around the pivot such that all elements on left
//             of pivot are smaller than or equal to pivot, and all elements on right of pivot are greater than pivot. Then,
//             we recursively apply the same logic to left and right sub-arrays of pivot and finally the whole array gets sorted.

// ‚óè How to partition the array around the pivot element ?
//   1. Choose a pivot element. Here, we are choosing the first element of the array as pivot.
//   2. Take two pointers i and j. Initialize i to the first index and j to the last index of the array.
//   3. Increment i till we find an element greater than pivot. Decrement j till we find an element smaller than or equal to pivot.
//      Hence, i stands at the first element encountered from left which is greater than pivot, and j stands at the first element
//      encountered from right which is smaller than or equal to pivot.
//   4. If i is still less than j, it means we have found two elements which are at wrong halves, so we swap them. Repeat
//      steps 3 and 4 till i meets or crosses j.
//   5. Once i meets or crosses j, j comes to the region where every element is smaller than or equal to pivot. So, we swap the
//      pivot element with the element at j. Now, pivot is at its correct position.
//   6. Return j as the partition index, .i.e., the correct index of pivot element.
