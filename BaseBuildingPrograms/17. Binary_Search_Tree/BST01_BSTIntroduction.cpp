// -> A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where the left child of a node contains values less
//    than the node's value, while the right child contains values greater than the node's value. Hence, at any node of BST,
//    all nodes in its left subtree is always less than it, and all nodes in its right subtree is always greater than it. This
//    property enables efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, making BSTs suitable for applications requiring
//    ordered data storage and retrieval.

// -> To search a node in BT, the time complexity was O(N) where N = no. of nodes in the tree; whereas the search time complexity
//    in a BST is O(H) where H = height of the tree. Height of a balanced tree is usually logN, therefore in average cases the
//    search time complexity of a BST is O(logN).

// -> The INORDER TRAVERSAL of a BST always gives a sorted array.
