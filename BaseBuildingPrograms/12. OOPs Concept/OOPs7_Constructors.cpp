// A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called each time 
// an object of the class is created. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the
// object's data members and set up the object's initial state.

// Properties of constructors are:
// 1) Constructor is an instance member function of class. It can never be static.
// 2) The name of constructor must be same as class name.
// 3) It has no return type.
// 4) Constructors must be placed in section of class.
// 5) If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for object
//    which expects no parameter and has an empty body.
