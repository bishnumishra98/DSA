// There are 3 types static members in C++:
// 1) static local/global variables
// 2) static member variables
// 3) static member functions

// Below is the illustration for static member variables:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
// Properties of static member variables:

// 1) By default initialized to 0, and scope throughout the program.

// 2) Declared inside class body, and defined outside body of class.

// 3) They do not belong to any object unlike other instance members of class, i.e. they can be used
//    by any object. They are also called class variables.

    return 0;
