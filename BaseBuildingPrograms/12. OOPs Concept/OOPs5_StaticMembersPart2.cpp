// There are 3 types static members in C+ :
// 1) static local/global variables
// 2) static member variables
// 3) static member functions

// Below is the illustration for static member variables:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
// Properties of static member variables:

// 1) By default initialized to 0, and scope throughout the program.

// 2) Declared inside class body, and defined outside body of class.

// 3) they do not belong

    return 0;
