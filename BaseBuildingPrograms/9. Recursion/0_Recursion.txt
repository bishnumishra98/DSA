There are 3 parts of a recursive program :-

1) Base case: It is a mandatory step. If this step is missed, program results in run-time memory overflow.
It tells the program where to stop.

2) Recursive relation / recursive call: It is also a mandatory step. It calls next function in stack.

3) Processing: This part of program is optional for some programs. It is basically some processing block.


Go through recursion in the following sequence:-

1) FactorialOfANumber

2) PrintNaturalNumbers

3) SumOfNaturalNumbers

4) PowerOfTwo

5) FibonacciSeriesNthTerm

6) LCMOfTwoNumbers

7) PrintingElementsOfAnArray

8) LinearSearchInAnArray
