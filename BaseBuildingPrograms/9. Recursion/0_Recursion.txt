There are 3 parts of a recursive program :-

1) Base case: It is a mandatory step. If this step is missed, program results in run-time memory overflow.
It tells the program where to stop.

2) Recursive relation / recursive call: It is also a mandatory step. It calls next function in stack.

3) Processing: This part is not required for some programs. It is basically a processing block of code.


Practice recursion in the following sequence :-

1) FactorialOfANumber

2) PrintNaturalNumbers

3) SumOfNaturalNumbers

4) PowerOfTwo

5) FibonacciSeriesNthTerm

6) LCMOfTwoNumbers   // very important

7) PrintingElementsOfAnArray

8) LinearSearchInAnArray

9) FindMinimumElementInArray

10) InsertEvenNumbersInVector

11) PrintIndexesOfAllOccurrence

12) PrintDigitsOfAGivenNumber

13) CheckIfArrayIsSorted

14) BinarySearchInArray

15) SubsequencesOfString

Question 16, 17, 18 follow a pattern called "exploring all possible ways" :-

16) MaximizeTheCutSequence

17) CoinChange

18) HouseRobber

19)
