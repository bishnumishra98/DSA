// This is an extension of the previous problem 'DP02_FrogJump.cpp'. The only difference
// being instead of at max 2 steps, the frog can jump at max k steps this time.

// Example 1:
// Input:
// n = 10, k = 3, heights = {10, 50, 30, 40, 10, 40, 60, 50, 20, 60}
// Output:
// 
// Explanation:
// 

// Algorithm:
// In the previous problem, when frog could jump at max 2 steps, there were 2 paths. Here when
// frog can jump at max k steps, there will be k paths to reach 'n-1'th index of heights.
