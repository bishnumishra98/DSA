// Leetcode: 354. Russian Doll Envelopes   --->   You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where
// envelopes[i] = [wi, hi] represents the width and the height of an envelope.
// One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the
// other envelope's width and height.
// Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).
// Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.

// Example 1:
// Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).

// Example 2:
// Input: envelopes = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
// Output: 1

// Algorithm: A cakewalk problem. It is just an extension of LIS problem 'Leetcode&Gfg\13. Dynamic_Programming\43_LongestIncreasingSubsequence.cpp'.
// 1. Sort the envelopes by width in increasing order. If two envelopes have the same width, sort them by height in
//    decreasing order.
// 2. After sorting, the problem reduces to finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) based on height.

// ‚óè Why to sort height in decreasing order when width is the same ?
//   - If we have two envelopes with the same width, we want to ensure that we do not count both of them in the LIS.
//     If we sorted by height in increasing order, we could end up counting both envelopes with the same width, which
//     would violate the condition that one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly greater.
//   - By sorting by height in decreasing order, we ensure that we only consider one of the envelopes with the same width,
//     thus maintaining the strictness required for the problem.
//   For more, try out dry run for: envelopes = [[4,5],[4,6],[6,7],[2,3],[1,1]];   correct o/p: 4
//   But if you don't sort height in decreasing order for same wdiths, then you will get an output of 5, which is wrong.
